CIND820 - Big Data Analytics Porject

This is the repository for my Capstone project for the final course towrad the Certificate in Data Analytics, Big Data, and Predictive Analytics from Ryerson University. 

## Abstract
With COVID-19 rampaging the world and many economies brought to their knee under the hard grasp of hard economy reality, corporations and most importantly financial institutions must be able to stay afloat to support and help stimulate their respective country economy. 

### Problem 
Understanding the model and ability to predict a customer that may leave will allow the bank to take appropriate steps to mitigate and retain such customer as necessary.

### Dataset
Bank Turnover Dataset - an open-source data available at https://www.kaggle.com/barelydedicated/bank-customer-churn-modeling

### Methods
* Exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships of the dataset features. 
* Multiple classification algorithms and explore which of the corresponding model would be the best fit to predict the possibility of bank customer leaving. 

## Literature Review
[View Code](https://github.com/microwales/CIND820/blob/main/data_description.ipynb)
* Quick Review of similar academic works (research, journals, reports, pojects, etc.) carried out on the dataset or other similar dataset
* Brief Data Exploratory Analysis
## Initial Results & Code
